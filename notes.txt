It takes about 1 day to bin a month's worth of data.



WEB WORKERS:
The following methods call rebin:

o - addRawData
x - replaceRawData
o - addBinnedData
x - replaceBinnedData
x - rebinAll

o's are both called by incomingRequestedData
addRawData is called before my() is defined.
x's are not called by the client.

rebin: in webworker
       - NOT WORKING
next up: addRawData, addBinnedData
         my.update() (which calls my(slcn) is taking up most of the time)
         - likely generating all of the d0s is taking so long.
