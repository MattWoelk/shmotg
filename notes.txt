To communicate to/from server we need the following information:
- which bin level
- which sensor
- date range
- date and time have to be stored in all of this somehow
  - this will affect how rendering is being done perhaps
  - xScale will be affected
- have to choose whether to render based on what we have, or to request more data
  - the default rendering should be in the client, then requested to the server
- when to free up ram by deleting things? Otherwise browsing for a long time will get ridiculous.
  - only delete data lower than a certain level?
