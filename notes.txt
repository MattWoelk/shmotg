It takes about 1 day to bin a month's worth of data.



WEB WORKERS:
The following methods call rebin:

o - addRawData
x - replaceRawData
o - addBinnedData
x - replaceBinnedData
x - rebinAll

o's are both called by incomingRequestedData
addRawData is called before my() is defined.
x's are not called by the client.

rebin: in webworker
       - NOT WORKING
next up: addRawData, addBinnedData
         my.update() (which calls my(slcn) is taking up most of the time)
         - likely generating all of the d0s is taking so long.


All the functions which call bd directly:

addRawData
    addData
addBinnedData
getDateRange


List of events after which lines should be redrawn:
- user scrolls too far
- level is changed
- new data is received from the server
- lines are shown/hidden
- interpolation method is changed
- initPlot
- basically, whenever rebin() is called ???
  - and when the level/lines is/are changed

Must be moved over to worker.js:
- getDateRangeWithMissingValues
- basically the entire generate d0s section
- move all of selection.each to an update() function ???
  - which is only triggered by worker.js
- missingBins
  - only called by getDateRangeWithMissingValues
